Common questions about the Email Verifications

Does an email address marked "deliverable" have no chance of bouncing?
The verifications are never totally sure, but we can guarantee that more than 95% of "deliverable" email addresses won't bounce.

What exactly does it mean when an email address is marked "risky"?
When an email address is tagged "risky", it means the server check seems to work, but we have reason to believe the email may not be read by anyone.

This can happen in several cases, for example:

The email seems to be received, but the servers also seem to accept every email address.
The email seems to be received, but it looks like gibberish (for example "e9v3mc3@company.com").
How many requests are counted for Email Verifications?
Every verification counts as one request. With a free account, you can use up to 100 requests/month. If you need more, you can upgrade to the plan that suits your needs. Please check our pricing for more information.

What do you check for when verifying emails?
This is the list of verifications we do:

Valid format: First, we verify the format of the email address is correct and looks something like "email@provider.com".
Gibberish Email Address: We check to ensure the address doesn't look like a random email address. For example, 1e49cs1pb6@company.com doesn't pass the test.
Disposable Email Address: We check if the email address has a domain name used for temporary email addresses.
Webmail Email Addresses: We verify if the email address uses a webmail like Gmail or Yahoo.
Presence of MX Records: We check if there are MX records on the domain. If there aren't, the email address can't receive emails.
Presence of SMTP Server: This check is successful if we are able to connect to the SMTP server (indicated in MX records).
SMTP Check: We test the email address and see if it bounces or not.
Accept-all Domain: We check if the server has a catch-all policy which accepts all the email addresses.
